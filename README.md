# Infinity Scroll

This is a simple project to practice making API calls. No libraries were used to build this only HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Getting a copy of this project up and running is simple, just clone the repo and open the index.html file in a browser.
You will need to modify line 13 of script.js to include an api key.
